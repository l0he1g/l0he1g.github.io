My name is Andrew Carter. I live near Seattle, WA. I am a software engineer for [Flipboard].

I studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington. Previous to Flipboard, I worked for [Amazon Web Services][aws] on an unreleased service. Before that, I worked three years for [Hulu] where I was a Principal Developer on the devices team. I worked extensively on the [AppleTV][apple] application. I also worked on backend services, PlayStation 3, Roku, iOS, and Android applications.

I started my career at [Microsoft] where I did two internships on the Mac Excel team. I worked fulltime for Microsoft from 1995 to 2005 in SQL Server, bCentral, and Xbox Live. I also have worked at several startups including Source Labs, Pure Networks, and Jobster. Additionally, I worked at Getty Images for three years as a Senior Software Engineer where I worked on contributor portals including the Flickr partnership.

Outside of work, I'm an avid cyclist and skier. I also enjoy football especially the Seattle Sounders.
